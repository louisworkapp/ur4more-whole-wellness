# Walk in the Light — Renewing the Mind (KJV)

**Aim:** Learn why renewing the mind is essential to walk daily in the light of Christ.

## 1) Why renewal?
> *"Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind."* — **Romans 12:2 (KJV)**  
The world presses us into its mold. Jesus frees us by reshaping our thoughts to match God's truth.

**Key idea:** What you rehearse, you become. Renewed thoughts → renewed choices → a renewed life.

## 2) How does God renew us?
- **By His Word:**  
  > *"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly…"* — **Colossians 3:16**  
  Scripture plants true patterns in the mind.

- **By His Spirit:**  
  > *"…renewing of the Holy Ghost"* — **Titus 3:5**  
  The Spirit applies truth to the heart, giving power to live it.

- **By Fixing Our Focus:**  
  > *"Whatsoever things are true… think on these things."* — **Philippians 4:8**

## 3) What does walking in the light look like?
- **Single-minded devotion:** no double-minded drift (James 1:8).  
- **Peace under pressure:** prayer replaces panic (Philippians 4:6–7).  
- **Obedient action:** truth becomes steps, not just ideas (Joshua 1:8).

## 4) 3 daily practices (5–7 minutes)
1. **Verse + Breathing (60–120s):** steady breath, read a short KJV verse from the set, repeat the key line.
2. **Truth Audit (2–3 min):** one lie → one KJV truth → one action today.
3. **Gratitude 3×30s (90s):** note three gifts; close with a 1-line thanks.

> Promise: *"Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee."* — **Isaiah 26:3**

**Prayer:**  
*Lord Jesus, renew my mind by Your Word and Spirit. Keep me in Your light today. Amen.*
