# UR4MORE Discipleship Core (12 Weeks)

A practical 12-week journey to follow Jesus deeply and live on mission.

## Week 1 — New Life by Grace (Regeneration & the Two Adams)
- **KJV**: Eph 2:8–9; 2 Cor 5:17; Jn 3:3–8; Tit 3:5; Ezek 36:26–27; Rom 5:12–19; 1 Cor 15:22, 45–49  
- **Unlocking Truth (KJV)**: *1 Cor 15:22* — "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."  
- **Summary**: By grace we are saved and made new—born from above by the Spirit. In Adam we inherit sin and death; in Christ we receive righteousness and life. Regeneration gives a new heart and begins an obedient life empowered by the Spirit.  
- **Practice**:  
  - Daily thanksgiving for new birth (Ezek 36:26–27).  
  - Memorize Eph 2:8–9 and 1 Cor 15:22.  
  - Lectio on John 3:1–8; journal one sentence: "What new life means for me."  
- **Reflect**:  
  - Where do "old Adam" patterns still steer me?  
  - How does being made alive in Christ transform my view of obedience?
