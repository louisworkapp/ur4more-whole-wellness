# UR4MORE Product Vision Document

**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Status:** Documentation in Progress  
**Document Owner:** Product Team

---

## 1) One-Sentence Pitch

**UR4MORE in one sentence:**  
A holistic wellness app that delivers evidence-based physical, mental, and spiritual health tools with optional faith integration, guiding users toward Jesus Christ as their True North while respecting their choice at every step.

**Who it's for:**  
Adults (13+) seeking wellness, personal growth, and meaningful change—from those wanting secular tools to committed believers wanting integrated spiritual wellness.

**Primary pain it solves:**  
Fragmented wellness tools that ignore the whole person; secular apps that miss deeper meaning; faith apps that lack clinical rigor; lack of consent-respecting faith integration.

---

## 2) Brand DNA

**Mission:**  
*(To be defined - inferred from creed and philosophy)*  
Guide users from darkness into light through evidence-based wellness tools and respectful faith integration, pointing toward Jesus Christ as ultimate truth and healing.

**Vision:**  
*(To be defined)*  
A world where wellness integrates body, mind, and spirit, with millions finding wholeness through tools that respect their journey and point toward ultimate truth.

**Core Values:**
- **Two Powers Framework**: Light (God, truth, order, responsibility, service) vs Darkness (lies, chaos, meaninglessness)
- **Truth Axis**: Every secular concept maps to biblical truth
- **Consent-First Evangelism**: Never coerce, always respect choice
- **Clinical Excellence**: Evidence-based (CBT/MI/ACT), licensed oversight
- **Theological Accuracy**: KJV-only, doctrinal consistency, interdenominational respect
- **Integrity**: No manipulation, transparent telos, honest recommendations

**"Non-negotiables" (what we will NOT do):**
- Coerce users into faith content
- Compromise clinical standards for any reason
- Use prohibited content (yoga, chakra, mantra, tarot, astrology, namaste)
- Store sensitive mental health data without consent
- Provide diagnosis or treatment (coaching/self-help only)
- Force faith overlays without consent (Light mode requires per-session consent)
